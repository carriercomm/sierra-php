The SRA_EntityModeler allows SIERRA framework applications to define their object model in xml including entities, entity relationships, validation, and o/r mappings. The SRA_EntityModeler is essentially a DAO/VO generator. No build is required as all initializations are performed automatically the first time that the entity model is used and thereafter only updated when changes are made to the entity model.

For more information, see the app-config dtd and the entity-model dtd.
