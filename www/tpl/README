SIERRA Framework templates. Each template provides its own inline documentation 
in the form of smarty comments. The test directory contains SRA_TestCase output 
templates (currently only 1). The sra-html-footer.tpl, sra-html-header.tpl and 
templates contained in the model directory are reusable view components that may 
be used to render entities described in an entity model. there are templates for 
displaying forms, lists, tables, grids and more. for more information, view the 
comments in entity model dtd (sierra/lib/model/entity-model.dtd) and the
