= sierra-php Installation =
The latest version of this documentation is available here: 
http://code.google.com/p/sierra-php/wiki/Install

==Install from source archive==
 # Download and extract the latest version of the framework from http://code.google.com/p/sierra-php/downloads/list (e.g. `sierra-php-1_x_x.tgz`)
 # Configure the framework: `shell> php /path/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-quick-install.php` 
    * Note: this will install the framework using the most common options. To customize your installation use the sierra-php installer: `shell> /source/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-installer.php` and select the `Configure framework` option

==Install using rpm==
When installing using the rpm, the framework is automatically installed to */var/www/sierra* 
 # Download rpm and install rpm
 # If you want to fine tune your framework settings use the sierra-php installer: `shell> /source/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-installer.php` and select the `Configure framework` option

==Install from subversion==
 # `svn checkout http://sierra-php.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sierra-php`
 # Configure the framework: `shell> php /path/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-quick-install.php` 
    * Note: this will install the framework using the most common options. To customize your installation use the sierra-php installer: `shell> /source/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-installer.php` and select the `Configure framework` option

=Installing an application=
Once the framework has been installed and configured, you can set up your first application also using the installer. To do so, follow these steps:
 # Start the installer: `shell> /path/to/sierra-php/bin/sra-installer.php`
 # Select the `Configure application` option
 # Select `Install new application`
 # Select `Install new application` again
 # Provide the desired application settings

=Notes=
 * Use of PHP memory caching is also highly recommended (but not required). The [http://pecl.php.net/package/APC Pecl APC Extension] works well and is easy to install on RedHat/CentOS (`yum install php-pecl-apc`). [http://xcache.lighttpd.net xcache] and [http://eaccelerator.net eAccelerator] are both slightly faster (about 10-15%)
 * If you plan to use any of the image manipulation features provided by `sierra/lib/model/SRA_FileAttribute.php`, you should also install the `ImageMagick` package
 * `php-readline` is highly recommended if you intend to use the sierra-php CLI
 *  disabling `selinux` for Apache may be required depending on the types of things you are doing in your application:
{{{
setsebool -P httpd_disable_trans 1
vi /etc/selinux/targeted/booleans
  ADD: httpd_disable_trans=1
service httpd restart
}}}
